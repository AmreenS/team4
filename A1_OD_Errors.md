  Audris asked us to create a list of operational data errors in the data that we analyzed for Assignment 1. We'll be presenting our findings Monday in class.
  
  Some common errors to look for are located in his <a href="https://github.com/fdac/presentations">prelim.pdf</a> presentation. 
  Feel free to add to the list.
